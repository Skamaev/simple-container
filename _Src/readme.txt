todo
	separate phase (and data structures) for dependency analysis => meta, contractUsage + factories, generics

	explicit stack machine instead of recursion

	refactor: get rid of stupid EndResolveDependencies

	type, enumerable<constract> -> ContractsSet or something

	speed up factories: should be no reflection at runtime

	reuse configurators between local containers/static container ?
